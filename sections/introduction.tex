Query C++ is a modern C++ library for formulating SQL queries with the goal to remove the need for writing raw SQL strings in C++.
Query C++ is open source and released under the BSD license


\subsection{Why is Query C++ not an ORM?}

Query C++ is not an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) framework and it has never been the purpose of Query C++.
There are many great ORM frameworks for C++ and other programming language which ease the integration with Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).
But in some use-cases the usage of fully blown ORMs are out of proportion when the mapping is not needed.
Query C++ aims to fill the space between an ORM and raw SQL query strings.
